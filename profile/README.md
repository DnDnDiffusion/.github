Step 0: [D&amp;D Diffusion Chainlink Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/dndiffusion)

Step 1: [Operation Dragonborn Next Steps Grant](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/1232)

Step 2: [The Bacalhau Grimoire Next Next Steps Grant](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/1377)

Whether or not you've always wanted to play D&D but never had the attention span to complete onboarding session, we've assembled a sweet suite of tools into an app that could, with a little prize money and grants, save up to an hour!  Times a million players, that's a lot more fun.  Hopefully, this team can level up our AI, and find a way to connect these Trained Stable Diffusion D&D Avatars to real human artists for a commissions market / artathon.  Pick a Character Sheet from the uploaded list, and let us know how much time you spent on it, and how much you'd like to sell it for.  Fireball.

# This Project:
1. [our front-end](https://github.com/DnDnDiffusion/Front-end)
1. [current smart contracts](https://github.com/DnDnDiffusion/DragonBorn-NFTS)
1. Our backend is currently transistioning from temporary Colab endpoints to a stable high-speed dockerized solution.

## [NFT.Storage on the Front-end](https://github.com/DnDnDiffusion/Front-end/blob/main/utils/web3utils.js)

> In order to provide immutable NFT storage, we used IPFS and NFT.Storage's JavaScript API.

## [Chainlink VRF2 & NFT.Storage Scaffold-D&D](https://github.com/DnDnDiffusion/scaffold-dnd)

> First, roll the dice, then wait and discuss the game, soon you'll have a random public/secret mission and can mint your character avatar after our trained stable diffusion model has return the CID to be saved as the tokenURI in the smart contract (VRFD22.sol / YourContract.sol)
