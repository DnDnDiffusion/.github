D&amp;D Diffusion Chainlink Hackathon

Whether or not you've always wanted to play D&D but never had the attention span to complete onboarding session, we've assembled a sweet suite of tools into an app that could, with a little prize money and grants, save up to an hour!  Times a million players, that's a lot more fun.  Hopefully, this team can level up our AI, and find a way to connect these Trained Stable Diffusion D&D Avatars to real human artists for a commissions market / artathon.  Pick a Character Sheet from the uploaded list, and let us know how much time you spent on it, and how much you'd like to sell it for.  Fireball.

# [Chainlink VRF2 & NFT.Storage Scaffold-D&D](https://github.com/DnDnDiffusion/scaffold-dnd/blob/master/README.md)

> First, roll the dice, then wait and discuss the game, soon you'll have a random public/secret mission and can mint your character avatar after our trained stable diffusion model has return the CID to be saved as the tokenURI in the smart contract (VRFD22.sol / YourContract.sol)

# [NFT.Storage on the Front-end](https://github.com/DnDnDiffusion/Front-end/blob/main/utils/web3utils.js)

> In order to provide immutable NFT storage, we used IPFS and NFT.Storage's JavaScript API.
